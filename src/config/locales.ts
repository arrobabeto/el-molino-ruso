/**
 * Single source of truth for locales, imported by both `astro.config.ts` and
 * the type layer.
 *
 * To change the shipped language, edit `LOCALES` and `DEFAULT_LOCALE`.
 *
 * To add a second locale, add it to `LOCALES` and set `i18n.routing` to
 * `"manual"` in `astro.config.ts`. Astro's built-in i18n is folder-based and
 * does not combine with the root `[...slug]` catch-all a CMS-driven site
 * needs, so this template derives the locale from URL segments itself.
 * See docs/00-TEMPLATE-BLUEPRINT.md §7.6 and ADR-0006.
